Devilspie2 is a window matching utility, allowing the user to 
perform scripted actions on windows as they are created. For example 
you can script a terminal program to always be positioned at a 
specific screen position, or position a window on a specific 
workspace. 

Devilspie2 is based on the program Devilspie by Ross Burton. The 
difference is that Devilspie2 has replaced the symbolic expressions 
of the original with a LUA interpreter, making it much easier to 
maintain and extend.

Please note that the rules of Devilspie2 is not compatible with the 
symbolic expressions of the original Devilspie.

There is a README with the syntax in usr/doc/devilspie2-0.28/README, 
as well as a manual (WIP) that can be found at
